# 🗞️ News Category Classification Web App - AG News

This is a clean and interactive **News Classifier App** built with **Streamlit**, based on the **AG News dataset**.  
It classifies short news articles or headlines into one of **four categories**:
- 🌍 **World**
- 🏅 **Sports**
- 💼 **Business**
- 🧪 **Sci/Tech**

Two models are implemented and switchable within the UI:
- **Logistic Regression (TF-IDF based)**
- **Neural Network (Tokenizer + Embedding Layer)**

---

## 📌 Features

✅ Clean & lemmatize text input  
✅ TF-IDF and Tokenizer-based pipelines  
✅ Supports two distinct model architectures  
✅ Displays predicted **category** and **confidence level**  
✅ User-friendly interface built in **Streamlit**  
✅ Includes notebook for full training & analysis
